# Have you seen this dog?
`Have you seen this dog` is a website dedicated to making website analytics easier than the modern landscape. Currently websites are packed with data, and analytics are getting more complicated than ever.

I want to bring forth a new age, a more simpler age. What if we knew our answer already? Questions like, have you seen an image? Was the image a dog? Have you seen _this_ dog?

This project hopes to bring about the ease of access to information like this. If only you knew at first glance the answer to your questions.
